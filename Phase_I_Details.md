# **Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App**

*Basic Level Functionality*

**Objective:** Build a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

💡**Development Approach:** Use the [Agentic Dev Stack workflow](#the-agentic-dev-stack:-agents.md-+-spec-kitplus-+-claude-code): Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.

## **Requirements**

* Implement all 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)  
* Use spec-driven development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus  
* Follow clean code principles and proper Python project structure

## **Technology Stack**

* UV  
* Python 3.13+  
* Claude Code  
* Spec-Kit Plus

## **Deliverables**

1. GitHub repository with:  
* Constitution file   
* specs history folder containing all specification files  
* /src folder with Python source code  
* README.md with setup instructions  
* CLAUDE.md with Claude Code instructions  
    
2. Working console application demonstrating:  
* Adding tasks with title and description  
* Listing all tasks with status indicators  
* Updating task details  
* Deleting tasks by ID  
* Marking tasks as complete/incomplete

# **Todo App Feature Progression**

## **Basic Level (Core Essentials)**

These form the foundation—quick to build, essential for any MVP:

1. Add Task – Create new todo items  
2. Delete Task – Remove tasks from the list  
3. Update Task – Modify existing task details  
4. View Task List – Display all tasks  
5. Mark as Complete – Toggle task completion status

## **Intermediate Level (Organization & Usability)**

Add these to make the app feel polished and practical:

1. Priorities & Tags/Categories – Assign levels (high/medium/low) or labels (work/home)  
2. Search & Filter – Search by keyword; filter by status, priority, or date  
3. Sort Tasks – Reorder by due date, priority, or alphabetically

## **Advanced Level (Intelligent Features)**

1. Recurring Tasks – Auto-reschedule repeating tasks (e.g., "weekly meeting")  
2. Due Dates & Time Reminders – Set deadlines with date/time pickers; browser notifications
