# **Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App**

*Basic Level Functionality*

**Objective:** Build a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

💡**Development Approach:** Use the [Agentic Dev Stack workflow](#the-agentic-dev-stack:-agents.md-+-spec-kitplus-+-claude-code): Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.

## **Requirements**

* Implement all 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)  
* Use spec-driven development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus  
* Follow clean code principles and proper Python project structure

## **Technology Stack**

* UV  
* Python 3.13+  
* Claude Code  
* Spec-Kit Plus

## **Deliverables**

1. GitHub repository with:  
* Constitution file   
* specs history folder containing all specification files  
* /src folder with Python source code  
* README.md with setup instructions  
* CLAUDE.md with Claude Code instructions  
    
2. Working console application demonstrating:  
* Adding tasks with title and description  
* Listing all tasks with status indicators  
* Updating task details  
* Deleting tasks by ID  
* Marking tasks as complete/incomplete
