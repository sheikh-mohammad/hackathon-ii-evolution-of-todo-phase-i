## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The shell commands failed initially due to powershell syntax differences. The PHR creation script also failed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Use individual shell commands instead of chained commands with `&&` in powershell.
