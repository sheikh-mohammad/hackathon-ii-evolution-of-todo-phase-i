# Update Test Files for Tick Listo Refactor

## Original Prompt Text

The user had already renamed the project from "todo" to "Tick Listo" but the test files still contained references to the old package structure. The requirement was to update all test files to use the new "ticklisto" package structure.

## Response Summary

Successfully updated all test files to reference the new "ticklisto" package structure:
- Updated import statements in all test files from `src.todo_app.*` to `src.ticklisto.*`
- Updated class instantiations from `TodoCLI()` to `TickListoCLI()` where needed
- Ran all tests to verify the changes work correctly
- All 47 tests pass successfully

## Outcome and Impact

All test files now properly reference the new "ticklisto" package structure, ensuring consistency across the entire codebase. The application maintains full functionality and all tests pass with the new naming convention.

## Files Modified

- ./tests/contract/test_api_contract.py
- ./tests/integration/test_cli_integration.py
- ./tests/unit/test_task.py
- ./tests/unit/test_task_service.py

## Tests Summary

- All 47 tests pass successfully
- Both unit and integration tests verified
- Contract tests confirmed working

## Next Steps

- Consider creating an ADR for the comprehensive renaming if architecturally significant
- Update any CI/CD pipeline configurations if they reference the old package name
- Verify documentation is consistent with the new naming

## Reflection

Properly updating test files is crucial when refactoring package structures. This ensures that all parts of the codebase maintain consistency and continue to function as expected after renaming operations.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] All test file imports updated to use new package structure
- [x] All tests pass successfully after changes
- [x] Consistency maintained across all test files
