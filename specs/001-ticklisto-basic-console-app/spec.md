### User Story 2 - Color-Coded Task Statuses (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see color-coded task statuses (green for completed, red for pending, yellow for in-progress) so that I can quickly identify task states at a glance.

**Why this priority**: Visual indicators significantly improve the user experience by allowing quick identification of task states without reading text descriptions.

**Independent Test**: The app should display completed tasks in green, pending tasks in red, and in-progress tasks in yellow using Rich styling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have tasks in different states, **When** I view the task list, **Then** completed tasks should appear in green, pending in red, and in-progress in yellow.
2. **Given** I change a task's status, **When** I view the list again, **Then** the color should update to reflect the new status.

---

### User Story 3 - Styled Task Tables (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see my tasks displayed in a styled table with borders and alternating row colors so that the information is organized and easy to read.

**Why this priority**: Professional presentation of data improves readability and makes the application feel more polished.

**Independent Test**: The app should display tasks in a Rich table with visible borders and alternating row colors for improved readability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple tasks, **When** I view the task list, **Then** tasks should be displayed in a table with clear borders and alternating row colors.
2. **Given** I have a long list of tasks, **When** I view the list, **Then** the table should remain readable with proper formatting.

---

### User Story 4 - Progress Tracking Visualization (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see progress bars showing task completion statistics so that I can visualize my productivity and track my progress over time.

**Why this priority**: Visual progress indicators provide motivation and help users track their achievements.

**Independent Test**: The app should display progress bars showing completion percentages when viewing overall statistics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple tasks, **When** I request progress statistics, **Then** I should see a progress bar showing the percentage of completed tasks.
2. **Given** I complete more tasks, **When** I view progress again, **Then** the progress bar should update to reflect the new percentage.

---

### User Story 5 - Enhanced Menu Navigation (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see beautiful menus with highlighted selections so that navigation is intuitive and visually appealing.

**Why this priority**: Enhanced menus improve the overall user experience and make the application more enjoyable to use.

### User Story 7 - Enhanced Add New Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to add new todo tasks to the console application with visual feedback so that I can keep track of my pending activities in a beautifully formatted way.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational feature that enables all other functionality - without the ability to add tasks, the app has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: The app should allow users to enter a task title and description, store it in memory, and confirm successful addition with a unique ID using Rich formatting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the console app is running, **When** I enter "add" command with a title and description, **Then** a new task should be created with a unique ID and displayed confirmation with Rich styling.
2. **Given** I have added a task, **When** I view the task list, **Then** the newly added task should appear in the list with proper formatting.

---

### User Story 8 - Enhanced View All Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to view all my tasks in a formatted list with Rich styling so that I can see what I need to do in an organized, professional manner.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user visibility of their tasks and core functionality of a todo app.

**Independent Test**: The app should display all tasks with their status (complete/incomplete), titles, descriptions, and IDs in a well-formatted Rich console output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have added multiple tasks, **When** I enter "view" or "list" command, **Then** all tasks should be displayed with their status indicators in a styled table.
2. **Given** there are no tasks, **When** I enter "view" command, **Then** the app should display an appropriately styled message indicating no tasks exist.

---

### User Story 9 - Enhanced Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete or toggle their status with visual feedback so that I can track my progress effectively.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that allows users to manage their task lifecycle with immediate visual confirmation.

**Independent Test**: The app should allow users to specify a task ID and change its completion status, with immediate Rich-styled feedback showing the updated status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a list of tasks, **When** I enter "complete" command with a valid task ID, **Then** that task's status should change to complete and be reflected in the UI with color change.
2. **Given** a task is marked as complete, **When** I enter "incomplete" command with the task ID, **Then** the task status should revert to incomplete with appropriate visual feedback.

---

### User Story 10 - Enhanced Update Task Details (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to update the details of existing tasks with confirmation feedback so that I can correct mistakes or modify task information.

**Why this priority**: Important for usability but secondary to the core create/read/complete functionality.

**Independent Test**: The app should allow users to specify a task ID and update its title or description, with Rich-styled confirmation of the changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have existing tasks, **When** I enter "update" command with a valid task ID and new details, **Then** the task should be updated with the new information and confirmation displayed with Rich formatting.
2. **Given** I try to update a non-existent task, **When** I enter "update" command with invalid task ID, **Then** the app should show an error message with appropriate styling.

---

### User Story 11 - Enhanced Delete Tasks (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to remove tasks that are no longer needed with confirmation feedback so that my task list stays organized.

**Why this priority**: Useful for maintaining a clean task list but less critical than core functionality.

**Independent Test**: The app should allow users to specify a task ID and remove it from the in-memory storage with Rich-styled confirmation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have existing tasks, **When** I enter "delete" command with a valid task ID, **Then** the task should be removed from the list with appropriate visual confirmation.
2. **Given** I try to delete a non-existent task, **When** I enter "delete" command with invalid task ID, **Then** the app should show an error message with appropriate styling.

---

### User Story 12 - Animated Loading and Transitions (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to see animated loading indicators and smooth transitions between views so that the application feels responsive and professionally designed.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience by providing visual feedback during operations and creating a polished feel.

**Independent Test**: The app should display loading animations during operations and smooth transitions between different views.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I trigger an operation that takes time, **When** the operation is processing, **Then** I should see an animated loading indicator.
2. **Given** I navigate between different views, **When** transitioning, **Then** I should see smooth transitions rather than abrupt changes.
