# Tasks: Intermediate Ticklisto Enhancements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-intermediate-ticklisto-enhancements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: TDD approach mandated by constitution - tests written FIRST, must FAIL before implementation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Project structure (from plan.md):
```
src/ticklisto/
├── models/task.py
├── services/
├── cli/
├── ui/
└── utils/

tests/
├── unit/

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P1 → P2 → P2)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 (but integrates well)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Completely independent

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD Red-Green-Refactor)
- Models/utilities before services
- Services before CLI commands
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All setup tasks can run sequentially (quick)
- **Phase 2 Tests**: T008-T014 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- **Phase 2 Implementation**: T015-T018 (Task model) must be sequential, T019-T023 (services) can be parallel after model is done
- **Once Foundational completes**: All 4 user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- **Within each story**: All test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phase 7**: T072-T076 (README updates) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD Red phase):
Task: "Write contract tests for backward compatibility in tests/contract/test_backward_compatibility.py"
Task: "Write integration tests for task creation with priority in tests/integration/test_task_operations.py"
Task: "Write integration tests for task update with categories in tests/integration/test_task_operations.py"
Task: "Write integration tests for displaying tasks with Rich in tests/integration/test_cli_commands.py"

# After tests fail, launch parallel implementation tasks:
Task: "Create Rich display components for priority indicators in src/ticklisto/ui/components.py"
Task: "Create Rich display components for category tags in src/ticklisto/ui/components.py"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 2 together (TDD Red phase):
Task: "Write unit tests for search_tasks in tests/unit/test_search_service.py"
Task: "Write unit tests for filter_tasks in tests/unit/test_filter_service.py"
Task: "Write unit tests for date filter logic in tests/unit/test_filter_service.py"
Task: "Write unit tests for category filter OR/AND in tests/unit/test_filter_service.py"
Task: "Write integration tests for combined search/filter in tests/integration/test_search_filter_integration.py"

# After tests fail, launch parallel service creation:
Task: "Create SearchService with search_tasks in src/ticklisto/services/search_service.py"
Task: "Create FilterService with filter_tasks in src/ticklisto/services/filter_service.py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T023) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T024-T038)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can now assign priorities and categories!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP! Priorities & Categories working)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Search & Filter added)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Sort added)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Clear command added)
6. Polish → Final release
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T023)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T024-T038) - Priorities & Categories
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T039-T055) - Search & Filter
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T056-T066) - Sort
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (T067-T071) - Clear command
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team reconvenes for Polish phase (T072-T080)

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 80
- Phase 1 (Setup): 7 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 16 tasks (7 tests + 9 implementation)
- Phase 3 (User Story 1): 15 tasks (4 tests + 11 implementation)
- Phase 4 (User Story 2): 17 tasks (7 tests + 10 implementation)
- Phase 5 (User Story 3): 11 tasks (5 tests + 6 implementation)

- Phase 7 (Polish): 9 tasks

**Test Tasks**: 25 (31% of total - strong TDD coverage)
**Parallelizable Tasks**: 35 marked with [P]

**User Story Breakdown**:
- US1 (Priorities & Categories): 15 tasks
- US2 (Search & Filter): 17 tasks
- US3 (Sort): 11 tasks
- US4 (Clear): 5 tasks

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Create task with priority/categories, view in formatted list
- US2: Search by keyword, filter by multiple criteria
- US3: Sort by due date/priority/alphabetically
- US4: Clear console with clear/clr command

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only) = 38 tasks

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- TDD approach: Write tests FIRST, verify they FAIL, then implement, verify they PASS
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution mandates: Test-First, Atomic Commits, Co-authoring with Claude Code
- Performance targets: Search <500ms, Filter <300ms, Sort <500ms for 10000 tasks

- **User Story 5 (Delete All)**: Depends on Phase 8 (ID management for reset)
- **User Story 6 (Required Fields)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **Enhanced Features**: Depend on Phase 8 (JSON persistence) and existing user stories

### Parallel Opportunities for New Phases

- **Phase 8 Tests**: T081-T088 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- **Phase 8 Implementation**: T089-T091 (StorageService) and T092-T094 (IDManager) can run in parallel
- **Phase 9 Tests**: T099-T103 can all run in parallel
- **Phase 10 Tests**: T109-T112 can all run in parallel
- **Phase 11 Tests**: T118-T122 can all run in parallel
- **Phase 11 Implementation**: T123-T125 can run in parallel
- **Phase 12**: T130-T136 (README updates) can all run in parallel

**Total Tasks**: 140

**New Phase Breakdown**:
- Phase 8 (JSON Persistence & ID Management): 18 tasks (8 tests + 10 implementation)
- Phase 9 (User Story 5 - Delete All): 10 tasks (5 tests + 5 implementation)
- Phase 10 (User Story 6 - Required Fields): 9 tasks (4 tests + 5 implementation)
- Phase 11 (Enhanced Features): 12 tasks (5 tests + 7 implementation)
- Phase 12 (Final Integration): 11 tasks

**New Test Tasks**: 22 (maintaining strong TDD coverage)
**New Parallelizable Tasks**: 28 marked with [P]

**Updated User Story Breakdown**:
- US1 (Priorities & Categories): 15 tasks (existing)
- US2 (Search & Filter): 17 tasks (existing)
- US3 (Sort): 11 tasks (existing)
- US4 (Clear): 5 tasks (existing)
- US5 (Delete All): 10 tasks (new)
- US6 (Required Fields): 9 tasks (new)

**Updated Independent Test Criteria**:
- US5: Delete all tasks with confirmation, ID counter resets to 1
- US6: Cannot create task without priority and at least one category
- Enhanced Search: Can specify search scope (title/description/both)
- Enhanced Clear: Terminal buffer completely cleared, no scroll-back
- Enhanced Update: Full re-entry of all fields required

**Updated MVP Scope**: Original MVP (Phases 1-3) + Phase 8 (JSON Persistence) + Phase 10 (Required Fields) = 65 tasks

## Updated Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Delivery with New Features

1. Complete original Phases 1-7 (if not done) → Original features working
2. Add Phase 8 (JSON Persistence & ID Management) → Data persists across restarts
3. Add Phase 10 (User Story 6 - Required Fields) → Mandatory priority/categories
4. Add Phase 9 (User Story 5 - Delete All) → Bulk delete with ID reset
5. Add Phase 11 (Enhanced Features) → Search scope, better clear, full re-entry
6. Complete Phase 12 (Final Integration) → All features documented and validated

### Parallel Team Strategy for New Phases

After completing original phases:

1. Team completes Phase 8 together (JSON Persistence & ID Management) - CRITICAL foundation
2. Once Phase 8 is done:
   - Developer A: Phase 9 (User Story 5 - Delete All)
   - Developer B: Phase 10 (User Story 6 - Required Fields)
   - Developer C: Phase 11 (Enhanced Features)
3. Team reconvenes for Phase 12 (Final Integration)
