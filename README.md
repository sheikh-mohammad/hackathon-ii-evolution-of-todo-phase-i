# Tick Listo

A command-line task management application with **persistent JSON storage** and advanced organization features. Built with Python 3.14+ and Rich for beautiful console formatting.

## Features

### Core Task Management
- Add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- **Auto-incrementing task IDs** (1, 2, 3...) that persist across sessions
- **JSON file persistence** (ticklisto_data.json) - tasks survive application restarts
- Rich-formatted console interface with visual status indicators
- Sub-second response times for all operations
- Graceful error handling with informative messages

### Advanced Organization
- **Priority Levels** (REQUIRED): Assign high, medium, or low priority to every task
- **Category Tags** (REQUIRED): Organize tasks with one or more category labels
- **Due Dates**: Set deadlines with flexible date parsing (MM/DD/YYYY, natural language like "tomorrow", "next week")
- **Search with Scope**: Find tasks by keyword in title only, description only, or both
- **Filter**: Filter tasks by status, priority, categories, and due dates
- **Sort**: Sort tasks by due date, priority, or alphabetically
- **Delete All**: Remove all tasks at once with confirmation prompt
- **Enhanced Clear**: Properly clear terminal buffer (not just scroll)

### Data Persistence
- **JSON Storage**: All tasks saved to `ticklisto_data.json` in the project directory
- **Atomic Writes**: Safe file operations prevent data corruption
- **ID Management**: Task IDs never reused during normal operation
- **ID Reset**: After "delete all", ID counter resets to 1 for fresh start

## Usage Examples

### Adding Tasks (Priority and Categories Required)

**Adding a task with required fields:**
```
> add
Enter task title: Complete project documentation
Enter task description (optional): Write comprehensive docs for the new features
Enter task priority (high/medium/low) *required: high
Suggested categories: work, home, personal
Enter task categories (comma-separated) *required: work, documentation, urgent
Add a due date? (y/n): y
Enter due date (MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, or 'tomorrow', 'next week', etc.): tomorrow

✓ Task added successfully with ID: 1
```

**Priority and categories are mandatory:**
```
> add
Enter task title: Buy groceries
Enter task description (optional):
Enter task priority (high/medium/low) *required: [press Enter without input]
❌ Priority is required. Must be one of: high, medium, low
Try again? (y/n): y
Enter task priority (high/medium/low) *required: medium
Enter task categories (comma-separated) *required: home, shopping

✓ Task added successfully with ID: 2
```

### JSON Persistence

**Tasks persist across application restarts:**
```
Session 1:
> add
[Create tasks with IDs 1, 2, 3]
> quit
Tasks saved successfully. Goodbye!

[Restart application]

Session 2:
> view
[All tasks from Session 1 are still there with IDs 1, 2, 3]
> add
[New task gets ID 4]
```

**Data file location:**
- All tasks stored in `ticklisto_data.json` in the project directory
- File uses atomic write operations for data safety
- Backup recommended before major operations

### ID Management

**IDs never reused during normal operation:**
```
> add
Task added with ID: 1

> add
Task added with ID: 2

> delete
Enter task ID to delete: 1
Task 1 deleted successfully!

> add
Task added with ID: 3  (NOT 1 - IDs never reused)
```

**ID counter resets after delete all:**
```
> view
[Shows tasks with IDs 5, 7, 9]

> delete all
⚠️  WARNING: Delete All Tasks
This will permanently delete ALL tasks and reset the ID counter to 1.
Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n): y
✓ All tasks deleted successfully
ID counter reset to 1

> add
Task added with ID: 1  (Fresh start!)
```

### Updating Tasks (Full Re-entry Required)

**Update requires re-entering all fields:**
```
> update
Enter task ID to update: 3

Current Task Details:
  Title: Old Title
  Description: Old Description
  Priority: medium

```

### Test Coverage

The project maintains comprehensive test coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: 75+ tests covering all services and models
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of CLI commands and workflows
- **Contract Tests**: Backward compatibility verification
- **Total Coverage**: 163+ passing tests

## Performance

The application is optimized for responsive performance:

- **Search**: < 500ms for up to 10,000 tasks
- **Filter**: < 300ms for up to 10,000 tasks
- **Sort**: < 500ms for up to 10,000 tasks
- **Task Operations**: Sub-second response for all CRUD operations

## Data Persistence

The application stores tasks in memory during runtime and persists them to a file named `ticklisto_data.json` when exiting. The file is automatically loaded when the application starts.

### Data Format

Tasks are stored with the following fields:
- `id`: Unique task identifier
- `title`: Task title (max 200 characters)
- `description`: Optional description (max 1000 characters)
- `completed`: Boolean completion status
- `priority`: Priority level (high/medium/low)
- `categories`: List of category tags
- `due_date`: Optional due date (ISO format)
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp

## Backward Compatibility

The application maintains full backward compatibility with existing task data. Tasks created without priority, categories, or due dates will automatically receive default values:
- Priority: `medium`
- Categories: `[]` (empty list)
- Due date: `None`
