# **Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App**

*Basic Level Functionality*

**Objective:** Build a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

## **Requirements**

* Implement all 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)
* Follow clean code principles and proper Python project structure

## **Technology Stack**

- UV for package management
- UV for dependency management
- Python 3.13+ for console application development
- Rich for beautiful CLI interfaces and terminal formatting
- GitHub for deployment
- Git for Version Control System
- In-memory data storage for Phase I

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- Console-based user interface for Phase I
- Local development environment

## **Deliverables**

* /src folder with Python source code
* README.md with setup instructions
2. Working console application demonstrating:
* Adding tasks with title and description
* Listing all tasks with status indicators
* Updating task details
* Deleting tasks by ID
* Marking tasks as complete/incomplete

## **Basic Level (Core Essentials)**

These form the foundation—quick to build, essential for any MVP:

1. Add Task – Create new todo items
2. Delete Task – Remove tasks from the list
3. Update Task – Modify existing task details
4. View Task List – Display all tasks
5. Mark as Complete – Toggle task completion status
